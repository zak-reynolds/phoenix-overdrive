# Phoenix Overdrive

## Description:
Drive a not so lonesome retrowave highway, steal the Prism, and make your getaway as the only authorities left try to stop you.

## Controls:
Controller A, Mouse Left: Drive
Controller Left Stick, Keyboard A & D: Steer
Controller A x 4, Mouse Left x 4: Activate Phoenix Drive (if HP available)

## Theme:
- Powering the car has multiple effects:
	- Pressing A (or Left Mouse Button) controls both the lights on the car and the wheels. Driving fast is hard, but it's the only way to see ahead of you.
	- The power also overtakes the wheels briefly, skidding the car for sharp turns.
	- Releasing A hits the brakes, stopping you quickly.
	- "Gearing up" (tapping A four times) will activate the Phoenix Overdrive
- The Parts pickup has a few effects, and effectively turns your HP into currency:
	- Add one to HP
	- Slows car. The idea is that Parts are bolted on to the car as armor, but we didn't have time to implement the visual effect, or the car model for that matter *shrug*.
	- Can be used to activate the Phoenix Overdrive, trading safety for speed and power.
